# The Ripple Effect: Could Taxing Unrealized Gains Stifle Innovation?


In my [previous blog on Dilution of Ownership](https://wcollins.io/posts/2024/understanding-dilution-of-ownership/), I explored how startup funding rounds impact equity. Now, let's dive into a hot-button, highly-debated, and dramatically misunderstood matter of policy - taxing unrealized capital gains _(or the wealth tax)_. Could this policy drastically alter the startup landscape? Would there be a tangible impact on founders, investors, and the innovation ecosystem as a whole?

## The Allure of Taxing Paper Wealth
On the surface, taxing unrealized gains - _(the increase in value of an asset that hasn't been sold yet)_ - might seem like a fair way to ensure the ultra-wealthy pay their "fair share." After all, why should founders sitting on billions in paper wealth escape taxation while their companies grow exponentially? It's never a pleasant experience observing a person or entity that has made it so far, getting outsized benefits and incentives. However, this simplistic view overlooks the complex realities of growing innovative companies and is worth examining the trade-offs and potential consequences.

## The Founder's Dilemma
Imagine our friend Taylor from the previous post. Her AI-powered music authentication platform has taken off, and her stake in the company is now worth $500 million on paper. Under a regime taxing unrealized gains, Taylor could face a massive tax bill without having ever seen a dime of actual profit. This creates several problems:

1. **Forced Liquidation**: To pay the tax, Taylor might need to sell a significant portion of her shares, potentially losing control of her company.
2. **Misaligned Incentives**: The pressure to constantly generate cash for taxes could push founders to prioritize short-term profits over long-term innovation and growth.
3. **Reduced Risk-Taking**: The prospect of being taxed on paper gains might discourage entrepreneurs from taking big swings on potentially world-changing ideas.

When founders are forced to focus on short-term liquidity instead of long-term vision, groundbreaking innovations that require years of development and uncertain outcomes become much less attractive propositions.

## The Ripple Effect on the Startup Ecosystem
The impacts of taxing unrealized gains extend far beyond individual founders:

### 1. Chilling Effect on Investment
Venture capitalists and angel investors might become more hesitant to back early-stage startups, knowing that taxes could significantly erode their potential returns before any exit event.

### 2. Delayed or Canceled IPOs
The prospect of triggering a massive tax bill upon going public could cause founders to delay or even cancel plans for an IPO, keeping innovative companies private for longer and reducing opportunities for public investment.

### 3. Brain Drain
Top talent might be less inclined to join startups if the potential upside of equity compensation is diminished by taxes on paper gains.

### 4. Global Competitiveness
In a global economy, entrepreneurs might choose to build their companies in jurisdictions with more favorable tax treatment, potentially causing the U.S. to lose its edge as the _darling_ of innovation.

## The Broader Market Impact
Beyond the startup world, taxing unrealized gains could have far-reaching consequences for the broader economy:

1. **Market Volatility**: Forced selling to cover tax bills could lead to increased market volatility, especially for less liquid assets.
2. **Reduced Capital Formation**: If investing becomes less attractive due to taxes on paper gains, it could lead to reduced capital formation and slower economic growth.
3. **Administrative Nightmare**: Determining the fair market value of illiquid assets for tax purposes would be a complex and potentially arbitrary process.

## The Government's Perspective: Revenue and Spending
While proponents of taxing unrealized gains often tout the potential for increased government revenue, it's crucial to examine the broader fiscal implications:

### Projected Revenue
Estimates of the revenue generated from taxing unrealized gains vary widely. [A 2021 proposal targeting billionaires](https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-unveils-billionaires-income-tax) was projected to raise approximately $557 billion over ten years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. However, these projections are subject to significant uncertainty due to market fluctuations and potential behavioral changes among those affected.

### Allocation of Funds
**$557 billion over 10 years** is a lot of green. Although never definitive, the intended use of this additional revenue often spans across:

1. Funding social programs
2. Infrastructure investment
3. Debt Reduction
4. Climate change initiatives

However, history suggests increased revenue only sometimes translates to these specific outcomes.

{{< admonition question "Is this really about Trust?" >}}
Sometimes, it's easy to get caught up in the outcome and avoid the details of how you might get there. I was talking to a good friend _(a resident of San Jose)_ a few weeks ago.  They shared their impression that California keeps increasing taxes but doesn't use the additional revenue as projected by state officials.  The lack of promised services in the face of additional taxes erodes trust. This observation is true at the federal level as well. {{< /admonition >}}

### The Spending Dilemma
There's a legitimate concern that any increase in tax revenue could be offset by increased government spending, potentially nullifying the fiscal benefits:

1. **Historical Precedent**: Analysis of U.S. fiscal policy shows that [increases in tax revenue are often accompanied by increases in government spending.]( https://www.mercatus.org/research/papers/tax-rates-and-revenue-story-so-far)
2. **Fiscal Illusion**: This phenomenon, [where the public perceives the cost of government to be less than it actually is](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025776), can lead to increased demand for government services when revenue increases.
3. **Political Incentives**: Policymakers may feel pressure to spend new revenue rather than use it for deficit reduction or long-term fiscal sustainability.

{{< admonition warning "Revenue vs. Efficiency" >}}
While taxing unrealized gains might generate additional revenue in the short term, could the potential negative impacts on economic growth and innovation actually reduce overall tax receipts in the long run?
{{< /admonition >}}

Consider credit card debt. Many Americans are neck-deep in heavy-interest debt; many of us live above our means. When we get a raise or a higher-paying job, we increase our spending habits instead of keeping them level. Rather than use that additional income to pay off debt, we often increase our debt by adding monthly payments. This same phenomenon can be observed with government spending.  

### Bang for the Buck?
Given the potential downsides we've discussed - reduced innovation, market volatility, and administrative complexities - it's worth questioning whether taxing unrealized gains would benefit society. The revenue generated might be substantial on paper, but if it comes at the cost of stifling the next generation of world-changing companies, the trade-off could be far from worth it.

Moreover, the complexity of implementing and enforcing such a tax could significantly reduce  generated revenue. The IRS would likely need substantial additional resources to administer this new system effectively.

As we consider these fiscal implications, it becomes clear that taxing unrealized gains is not just about generating revenue but would also alter the  fundamental structure of our economy and the incentives that spur innovation and growth.

## A Delicate Balance
Suppose the _multiverse_ exists outside of _Marvel_; no version of me would be a policymaker in any potential universe. Ensuring a fair tax system seems impossible and policymakers must tread carefully when considering changes that could fundamentally alter the incentives for innovation and entrepreneurship. Most things in life have unintended consequences. The bigger the problem, usually, the more adverse the consequences. The big question is, do the unintended consequences outweigh the short-term revenue gains? I'm glad I don't have to make that call!

{{< admonition tip "Food for Thought" >}}
Instead of focusing on taxing paper wealth, perhaps we should explore ways to incentivize long-term value creation, sustainable business practices, and a broader distribution of innovation's benefits throughout society.

## Conclusion
The debate around taxing unrealized gains highlights the delicate balance between generating government revenue and maintaining a vibrant, innovative economy. As we've seen, the potential downsides of such a policy could have far-reaching and long-lasting impacts on the startup ecosystem and beyond.

The future of innovation depends on finding more nuanced solutions that foster economic fairness and continued technological progress. What are your thoughts on this complex issue? How can we balance the need for a fair tax system with the imperative to encourage risk-taking and innovation?
