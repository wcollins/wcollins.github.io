In that experiment, I was using GPT-3.5. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take much to trip up the galactic AI in many of the experiments I did with Terraform and beyond. According to OpenAI GPT-4 soars past its predecessor in its advanced reasoning capabilities. Let&amp;rsquo;s use this model to build code in Python and Go. How will the super titan fair in the Sysadmin arena?</description></item><item><title>Setting Up Ansible (AWX) On Debian</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2020/setup-awx-on-debian/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 12:29:55 -0400</pubDate><author><name>William Collins</name></author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2020/setup-awx-on-debian/</guid><description>Ansible Tower VS AWXThe best way to learn is by constructing your own knowledge, not passively absorbing information. A lot of great projects are open source these days, including The AWX Project. At zero cost, you can build your automation skill set, increasing your chances at landing that next big promotion.
This post will cover how to setup Ansible AWX on Debian. I use a combination of Ansible and Terraform in the NetDevOps toolchain.</description></item></channel></rss>
