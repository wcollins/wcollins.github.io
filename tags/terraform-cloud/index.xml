In Part 2 and Part 3 we connected various networks (both cloud and on-premises) and provisioned NGFWs that scale to real-time capacity. By default, networks connected to our corporate segment have full-mesh connectivity to each other. Let&amp;rsquo;s build some policies in code that can work with the groups we created to produce logical micro-segmentation that mirror a few real-world use cases.

For Part 3, we will bring on-premises back into the spotlight and connect some sites over Cisco SD-WAN and IPSEC.
On-premises remains a strong focus for many enterprises through 2021 going into 2022. Some workloads, as noted by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, may never move to the cloud.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started With Alkira And Terraform (Part 2)</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2021/getting-started-with-alkira-and-terraform-part-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 09:26:46 -0400</pubDate><author>William Collins</author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2021/getting-started-with-alkira-and-terraform-part-2/</guid><description>In Part 1, we started with a scalable foundation that can adapt over time as the business grows and adjusts to changing markets. With Alkira&amp;rsquo;s Network Cloud, we take a cloud native approach in enabling our customer&amp;rsquo;s transformation. No appliances need to be provisioned in remote VPCs or VNets, and no agents need to be installed on workloads. Getting started is as easy as kicking off a build pipeline. For Part 2, let&amp;rsquo;s connect some networks from AWS, Azure, and GCP.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started With Alkira And Terraform - (Part 1)</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2021/getting-started-with-alkira-and-terraform-part-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 08:43:42 -0400</pubDate><author>William Collins</author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2021/getting-started-with-alkira-and-terraform-part-1/</guid><description>HashiCorp&amp;rsquo;s Terraform needs no introduction. It is all but the de facto vehicle for delivering cloud infrastructure, and for a good reason. What Terraform did for Multi-Cloud Infrastructure as Code, is precisely what Alkira does for the network. What happens when you use these two platforms together to deliver networking in and across clouds? If providing network services in code faster than ever before sounds interesting, this multi-part series is for you.</description></item><item><title>Intro To Terraform Modules With AWS</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2021/intro-to-terraform-modules-with-aws/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 08:46:40 -0400</pubDate><author>William Collins</author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2021/intro-to-terraform-modules-with-aws/</guid><description>Effectively automating infrastructure is no longer a luxury but a staple in the enterprise move through future transformation. I wrote a blog recently about using Terraform with Packer together, and wanted to take this thought further with breaking down Terraform Modules and getting well connected with Terraform Cloud. I recently put together a simple module for building base infrastructure in AWS for the purpose of testing Alkira Network Cloud. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in!</description></item></channel></rss>
