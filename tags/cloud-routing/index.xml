For Part 2, we will examine Azure network design patterns based on cloud maturity and organization size. The concept of design patterns was first introduced by Christopher Alexander and has profoundly influenced many technical disciplines.
To keep things simple, let&amp;rsquo;s define a design pattern as a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. Of course, you are not the first practitioner out there transitioning to cloud or growing to a new maturity model.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Azure Cloud Networking - (Part 1)</title><link>http://wcollins.io/post/2021/exploring-azure-cloud-networking-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 14:36:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://wcollins.io/post/2021/exploring-azure-cloud-networking-part-1/</guid><description>Is cloud networking complicated, or is it just different? In building your infrastructure in the cloud, end-to-end system complexity increases exponentially. As enterprise applications mature, the foundational infrastructure and networking used to host and transport them must evolve. One obvious crux of networking is blast radius - you cannot easily modify it without down-time.
This is Part 1 of a multi-part series that will explore Azure networking. To the best of my ability, this series will be written to articulate real-world scenarios and bring attention to specifics that are critical to an understanding before diving into cloud networking architecture.</description></item></channel></rss>
