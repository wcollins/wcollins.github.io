It is all but the de facto vehicle for delivering cloud infrastructure, and for a good reason. What Terraform did for Multi-Cloud Infrastructure as Code, is precisely what Alkira does for the network. What happens when you use these two platforms together to deliver networking in and across clouds? If providing network services in code faster than ever before sounds interesting, this multi-part series is for you.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Azure Cloud Networking - (Part 2)</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2021/exploring-azure-cloud-networking-part-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 13:11:59 -0400</pubDate><author><name>William Collins</name></author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2021/exploring-azure-cloud-networking-part-2/</guid><description>In Part 1, we went over some fundamentals. For Part 2, we will examine Azure network design patterns based on cloud maturity and organization size. The concept of design patterns was first introduced by Christopher Alexander and has profoundly influenced many technical disciplines.
To keep things simple, let&amp;rsquo;s define a design pattern as a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. Of course, you are not the first practitioner out there transitioning to cloud or growing to a new maturity model.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Azure Cloud Networking - (Part 1)</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2021/exploring-azure-cloud-networking-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 14:36:06 -0400</pubDate><author><name>William Collins</name></author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2021/exploring-azure-cloud-networking-part-1/</guid><description>Is cloud networking complicated, or is it just different? In building your infrastructure in the cloud, end-to-end system complexity increases exponentially. As enterprise applications mature, the foundational infrastructure and networking used to host and transport them must evolve. One obvious crux of networking is blast radius - you cannot easily modify it without down-time.
This is Part 1 of a multi-part series that will explore Azure networking. To the best of my ability, this series will be written to articulate real-world scenarios and bring attention to specifics that are critical to an understanding before diving into cloud networking architecture.</description></item></channel></rss>
