Most of the time, it is easy enough to find an answer online or even from ChatGPT. Other times, you may not be so lucky. The other day, I fell victim to a TWE or time wasting event that I thought was worth writing about.</description></item><item><title>Configuring Systems With ChatGPT, Python, and Go</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2023/configuring-systems-with-chatgpt-python-and-go/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2023 12:03:15 -0400</pubDate><author><name>William Collins</name></author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2023/configuring-systems-with-chatgpt-python-and-go/</guid><description>I recently wrote a blog about generating Terraform with ChatGPT.

How will the super titan fair in the Sysadmin arena?</description></item></channel></rss>
