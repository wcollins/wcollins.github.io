This event was planned, organized, and delivered by AWS <em>user group</em> leaders and was an absolute blast. I got to catch up with a few remarkable individuals I haven&rsquo;t talked to since <em>pre-pandemic</em>, and I got to meet many new people and listen to their stories of <em>transformation</em> in their respective enterprises.</p><p><img src=/images/2022/aws-community-day-midwest/intro.jpeg alt=intro></p><h2 id=small-package-major-home-run>Small Package, Major Home Run</h2><p><strong>AWS re:Invent</strong> is incredible, but it is a little like drinking from the firehose. So much to do, so many people to see, so many sessions, and a crowd like you&rsquo;ve never seen. <em>Community Day</em> is smaller, intimate, and focused. <a href=https://www.cscc.edu/community/conference-services/mitchell-hall-event-center.shtml>CSCC, Mitchell Hall</a> was used for the venue, which is an excellent facility for event hosting, and the <em>Community Leaders</em> did a fantastic job with organizing everything.</p><h2 id=my-talk>My Talk</h2><p>My talk was centered around my <em>real-life</em> experiences with navigating <strong>network complexity</strong> as businesses dive into the <strong>digital transformation</strong> deep-end. You can grab the slides <a href=https://github.com/wcollins/cruising-through-network-complexity>here.</a> One thing that did surprise me was how many other professionals in attendance were going through precisely what I had gone through in their respective organizations. Legacy infrastructure and company culture are no <em>respecter of persons</em>. If you want to take a listen, here is the link:</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjISOH6ssSQ style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=other-great-sessions>Other Great Sessions</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l8Vx_5Wdp4">Diagnosing Childhood Cancer with AWS Step Functions</a> presented by <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/grant-lammi-88aa30/>Grant Lammi</a>, was one of the major standout sessions for me. His talk focused on the difficulty of diagnosing and understanding why children have the cancers they do, what treatment is available, and how to get that treatment to them quicker. This involved a massive operation of sequencing the <em>DNA</em> of children throughout the <em>United States</em>. All the other sessions I attended were fantastic.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>It was refreshing attending an event <em>in-person</em> again. There is a <strong>contagious</strong> energy that these events bring, and I found myself going home motivated with lots of new ideas. Everyone is in a different stage of their journey, but no matter where you are, you will find someone who <em>emboldens</em> you or others you can <em>encourage</em>. That, my friends, is <em>community</em>.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=/tags/aws-community-day/>aws-community-day</a></div><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=/post/2022/terraforming-alkira-and-fortinet-is-multicloud-bliss/><i class="iconfont icon-left"></i>
