Whether it&rsquo;s anticipation for new product announcements or connecting in person with the community, there is something electrifying about being at <em>ground zero</em>. And if you can make the trip, you will get a lot of great exercise too! I hit close to <strong>100K steps</strong> or approx. <strong>43 miles</strong> according to my <em>Fitbit</em>. What were some of my favorite highlights from <strong>re:Invent 2022</strong>?</p><p><img src=/images/2022/aws-reinvent-2022-recap/intro.png alt=intro></p><h2 id=community>Community</h2><p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonrobertdunn/>Jason Dunn</a> put on a spectacular event for the <strong>AWS Community Builders</strong>. Intros were made to various members of the AWS team, community managers, topic leaders, developer advocates, and <em>DevRel</em> leadership. Even the legend, <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/jbarr/>Jeff Barr</a>, was there. The food was hot, the SWAG was hotter, and the conversation and <em>networking</em> was off the chain. These types of events are where major opportunities happen. Want to become a <em>Community Builder</em>? Check out our <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/>page</a>.</p><h2 id=attendance>Attendance</h2><p>There were over <strong>60K</strong> in attendance this year, and all the sessions I attended were excellent. You can find most of the events already available on the <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@AWSEventsChannel>AWS Events</a> YouTube channel.</p><p><img src=/images/2022/aws-reinvent-2022-recap/timelapse.gif alt=Timelapse></p><h2 id=network-announcements>Network Announcements</h2><p>My favorite category, <strong>Networking & Content Delivery</strong>, saw a few new product launches. Let&rsquo;s dig in!</p><h3 id=vpc-lattice>VPC Lattice</h3><p>Want consistent network policy and traffic management across instances, containers, and serverless? A new full managed service called <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/lattice/>VPC Lattice</a> is now in <em>preview</em>. This feels like a <em>service-mesh &ldquo;lite&rdquo;</em> aimed at scaling <em>service-to-service</em> connections while incorporating some <em>zero-trust</em>. Having visibility into <em>service-to-service</em> interactions is important.</p><p><img src=/images/2022/aws-reinvent-2022-recap/vpc-lattice.png alt="VPC Lattice"></p><h4 id=pricing>Pricing</h4><p><a href=https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/lattice/pricing/>VPC Lattice Pricing</a> is broken down into three components that ultimately decide how much that final bill will increase.</p><ul><li><strong>Per hour</strong> charge for each running service (that runs on instances, containers, or serverless). The price will differ per <em>region</em>, but for <em>US East</em> it is <strong>$0.0250/hr</strong></li><li><strong>Per GB</strong> charge for each gigabyte of data running through each service. Again, the price for <em>US East</em> is <strong>$0.0250/GB</strong></li><li><strong>Requests</strong> made to to each service are priced at a <strong>$0.10</strong> <em>per 1 million requests</em> rate. You begin getting charged once you exceed the <em>always free tier</em></li></ul><div class="admonition info"><p class=admonition-title>Preview Waitlist</p><p>Services are heavily restricted and controlled during <em>Preview</em> periods. <em>VPC Lattice</em> is only available in <strong>US West</strong> <em>(Oregon)</em> as of right now. You can get on the waitlist <a href=https://pages.awscloud.com/AmazonVPCLattice-Preview.html>here.</a> Preview is available for up to 5 AWS accounts at a time.</p></div><h3 id=verified-access>Verified Access</h3><p><em>VPNs</em> are getting a lot of hate these days, and <em>ZTNA</em> products are getting a lot of love. I&rsquo;m not surprised to see AWS release <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/verified-access/>Verified Access</a> for secure access to corporate applications. Like the bulk of <em>ZTNA</em> products on the market today, <em>Verified Access</em> uses conditions based on <em>identity data</em> and <em>device posture</em> for application access.</p><p><img src=/images/2022/aws-reinvent-2022-recap/verified-access.png alt="Verified Access"></p><h4 id=pricing-1>Pricing</h4><p><a href=https://aws.amazon.com/verified-access/pricing/>Verified Access</a> is broken down into two components that make up the final bill.</p><ul><li><strong>Application Hours</strong> is an hourly charge for associated applications, which comes in at <strong>$0.27/hr</strong> <em>for 1-148800 app-hours</em>. If you surpass <em>148800 app-hours</em>, this is reduced to <strong>$0.20/hr</strong>. Each partial application hour is rounded up and billed for the whole hour.</li><li><strong>GB of data processed</strong> is a <strong>$0.02</strong> per GB charge that gets processed for all data flowing between users and applications while using the service.</li></ul><div class="admonition danger"><p class=admonition-title>Services in Preview</p><p>Visit <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/>Service Terms</a> to learn more about the terms and conditions for all release types. Remember, <em>Preview</em> releases are not intended for production! You can check <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/>here</a> to see if new services are available in a given region.</p></div><h2 id=other-big-announcements>Other Big Announcements</h2><p>This year seemed bigger than ever, and if I had to pick one category that commanded a lot of attention, it was <em>data management</em>. Nobody says this as elegantly as the CEO:</p><div class="admonition quote"><p class=admonition-title>Adam Selipsky</p><p>To unlock the full power, the full value of data, we need to make it easy for the right people and applications to find, access and share the right data when they need it — and to keep data safe and secure.</p></div><h3 id=datazone>DataZone</h3><p><a href=https://aws.amazon.com/datazone/>DataZone</a> <em>aggregates</em> data sources, sets up a data catalog of sorts, and allows you to define a taxonomy. You can then govern access to data in one place. Let&rsquo;s face it, <em>data</em> is heavy, hard to manage, and time-consuming to make sense of. Anything that streamlines and simplifies administration is <em>winning</em>.</p><h3 id=security-lake>Security Lake</h3><p>Wherever there is <em>data</em>, security is not far behind. What happens when you combine <em>data lakes</em> and <em>security</em>? You get a purpose-built data lake for security-related data and name it <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/amazon-security-lake-preview/>Security Lake</a>. On the surface, this looks pretty valuable as it appears to aggregate data from the cloud and on-premises security infrastructure and solutions and normalize it with the <a href=https://github.com/ocsf>Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)</a>. In this long history of <em>security</em> and <em>data</em>, gathering tons of <em>data</em> was never a problem. Normalizing, understanding, and contriving value is.</p><h3 id=cloudwatch---internet-monitor>CloudWatch - Internet Monitor</h3><p><em>CloudWatch</em> got a new feature called <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/amazon-cloudwatch-internet-monitor-preview/>Internet Monitor</a> which enables you to continually monitor <em>internet</em> availability and performance metrics. The monitoring happens through your VPC, CloudFront distributions, and Workspaces directories. The goal is to arm operations with insight into how internet issues impact the performance of applications hosted in AWS and <em>end-users</em> accessing those applications.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>As always, <strong>re:Invent</strong> did not disappoint. There was a lot of <em>post-pandemic</em> excitement that was pretty contagious, and it was great to catch up with folks I hadn&rsquo;t seen in a while or had never met in <em>real-life</em>. When you get that many <em>builders</em> together, you know some magic is bound to happen.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=/tags/aws/>aws</a>
