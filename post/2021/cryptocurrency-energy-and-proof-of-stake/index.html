<h2 id=bitcoin---energy-consumption>Bitcoin - Energy Consumption</h2>
<p>The <em>Digital Assets Programme (DAP) Team</em> at <a href=https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance>The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance</a> maintains a fantastic project called <a href=https://cbeci.org/index>The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI)</a> that estimates the power demand for the Bitcoin network. The material presented gets updated every 24-hours. Today, the estimated annualized consumption of the <em>Bitcoin Network</em> is <strong>> 111 TWh</strong>. A <em>terawatt-hour</em> is one trillion watts per hour, equal to <strong>3.6x10<sup>15</sup></strong> Joules.</p>
<div class="admonition info"><p class=admonition-title>Info</p>
<p>The <em>CBECI</em> hypothesizes the consumption of the Bitcoin Network based on <a href=https://cbeci.org/index/methodology>this methodology</a>. The actual Bitcoin electrical consumption is impossible to measure based on several external factors that the methodology cannot include.</p>

<h2 id=consensus-mechanisms>Consensus Mechanisms</h2>
<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain>Blockchain</a> backed technologies like Bitcoin are essentially distributed databases which are bound by the laws of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem>CAP theorem</a>. With <em>blockchain</em>, nodes must reach an agreement on the current state of the network by using a consensus mechanism.</p>
<h3 id=what-is-consensus-with-blockchain>What Is Consensus With Blockchain?</h3>
<p>Consensus means agreement. With <em>blockchain</em>, that agreement happens when <strong>51%</strong> of the nodes on a network agree on its next global state. Consensus mechanisms <em>(or algorithms)</em> in a crypto-economic system enable networks to achieve this while preventing common attacks. A successful exploit, in theory, would compromise consensus by controlling <strong>>= 51%</strong> of the network. Consensus mechanisms exist to negate that <strong>51% attack</strong>.</p>
<h3 id=proof-of-work>Proof-of-Work</h3>
<p><a href=https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work>Proof-of-Work <em>(PoW)</em></a>, initially introduced in <strong>1993</strong> by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Dwork>Cynthia Dwork</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moni_Naor>Moni Naor</a> to mitigate <em>DDoS</em> attacks, is the consensus mechanism used by many cryptocurrencies today like <a href=https://bitcoin.org/en/>Bitcoin</a> and <a href=https://ethereum.org/en/>Ethereum</a>. This algorithm sets the difficulty and rules while the miners perform the actual work of adding valid blocks to the chain. <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/>Mining cryptocurrency</a> requires specialized hardware that uses a substantial amount of electricity. Also, as difficulty increases, so does the computational power necessary to get the hash value. The penalty for bad actors submitting invalid blocks is losing computational power, energy, and time.</p>
<div class="admonition question"><p class=admonition-title>Reflection</p>
<p>Zooming in further reveals that the mechanics of the underlying consensus mechanism underpins the need for the vast amount of energy required to power <em>Bitcoin&rsquo;s</em> network (or any other currency leveraging proof-of-work). Also, as difficulty and computation increase, <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mining-pool.asp>mining pools</a> begin to emerge as a centralized authority of sorts.</p>
</div>
<h3 id=proof-of-stake>Proof-of-Stake</h3>
<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake>Proof-of-Stake <em>(PoS)</em></a> was introduced in <strong>2012</strong> by <a href=https://decred.org/research/king2012.pdf>Sunny King and Scott Nadal</a> as an alternative to <em>proof-of-work</em>. At its core, <em>proof-of-stake</em> works to help reach consensus securely but does it in a fundamentally different way than <em>proof-of-work</em>. In a <em>proof-of-stake</em> system, miners don&rsquo;t need to spend electricity on adding valid blocks to the chain, thus allowing the network to operate with substantially lower resource consumption. The penalty for bad actors on a <em>proof-of-stake</em> network is more severe. The validators' staked funds serve as the incentive to refrain from malicious intent. If a validator accepts a bad block, a portion of their staked funds will be <em>slashed</em> as a penalty.</p>

<p>In a <em>proof-of-work</em> system, <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tragedy-of-the-commons.asp>Tragedy of the Commons</a> predicts a possible future in which the cost of mining becomes less lucrative when the block reward allowance becomes inconsequential. At this point, any rewards ultimately shift to transaction fees, thus opening the door to a potential <strong>51%</strong> attack. In <em>proof-of-stake</em> systems, the <a href=https://golden.com/wiki/Nothing-at-stake_problem>Nothing at Stake</a> problem, in theory, can disrupt consensus and make the system vulnerable to exploits like <a href=https://golden.com/wiki/Double-spend_attack_(blockchain)>double-spend attacks</a>.</p>

<h2 id=going-green>Going Green</h2>
<p>Depending on one&rsquo;s definition of going green, that wording could be a mild stretch. One thing is for sure, optimizing to use less energy is a win. What if <em>cryptocurrencies</em>, like Ethereum, could use <strong>~99.95%</strong> less energy by transitioning to <em>proof-of-stake</em> for consensus?</p>
<h3 id=ethereum---energy-consumption-and-scale>Ethereum - Energy Consumption And Scale</h3>
<p><a href=https://ethereum.org/en/>Ethereum</a>, the second-largest coin by market <em>capitalization</em>, was launched in <strong>2015</strong> by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin>Vitalik Buterin</a>. While <em>Bitcoin</em>, long-term, could be viewed more as a <em>store of value</em> similar to gold, Ethereum offers more utility with its <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract>smart contracts</a> driving the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance>decentralized finance (DeFi)</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token>NonFungible Token (NFT)</a> arena. Today, Ethereum uses <em>proof-of-work</em> for consensus, which presents limitations at scale. Not only does it consume a country&rsquo;s worth of power, but the blockchain also struggles to keep up due to popularity and demand. Smart Contracts, <em>NFT</em> minting + sales, and <em>DeFi</em> transactions increasing have caused a spike in fees.</p>

<h3 id=solving-for-power-and-scale-with-ethereum-20>Solving For Power And Scale With Ethereum 2.0</h3>
<p>Knowing the scalability and environmental challenges that come with <em>proof-of-work</em>, the Ethereum team has long-planned to upgrade to <em>proof-of-stake</em> consensus across <em>3 phases</em>, the first of which, <a href=https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/>The Beacon Chain</a> was implemented in <strong>Dec. 2020</strong>. The second phase, <a href=https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/merge/>The Merge</a> is slated for <strong>~Q2 2022</strong> at which point, staked <em>Ether</em> will take the place of <em>mining</em>. The last phase, <a href=https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/>Shard Chains</a>, could potentially ship as early as <strong>late 2022</strong> (depending on results of the merge), and greatly optimizes data and transactions.</p>
<h4 id=comparing-pow-and-pos-power-requirements><strong>Comparing PoW and PoS Power Requirements</strong></h4>
<p>A massive reduction in power can be observed when taking <em>mining</em> out of the picture. It is projected that Ethereum will use <strong>~99.95%</strong> less energy post-merge. Therefore, instead of comparing the entire network&rsquo;s consumption to a <em>medium</em> sized country, a more accurate comparison would be a small town of around <strong>2,000 homes</strong>.
<img src=/images/2021/crypto-energy-efficiency-and-proof-of-stake/pow-vs-pos-power-requirements.png alt="Ethereum - Energy Comparison"></p>
<h4 id=scaling-transactions><strong>Scaling Transactions</strong></h4>
<p>Visa <a href=https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html>handles an average of 150 million transactions every day</a>, or approximately <strong>1,736</strong> transactions-per-second. Today, Bitcoin handles somewhere between <strong>4-7</strong> transactions-per-second, with Ethereum coming in at around <strong>13</strong> transactions-per-second. The last phase of the shift to <em>proof-of-stake</em> introduces secure sharding, enabling Ethereum to create blocks simultaneously. According to <em>Vitalik Buterin</em>, this has the potential to scale up to <strong>~100K</strong> transactions-per-second.</p>
<blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>ETH2 scaling for data will be available *before* ETH2 scaling for general computation. This implies that rollups will be the dominant scaling paradigm for at least a couple of years: first ~2-3k TPS with eth1 as data layer, then ~100k TPS with eth2 (phase 1). Adjust accordingly.</p>&mdash; vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1277961594958471168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>Historically, precious metals were considered the <em>go-to</em> for hedging against inflation. Going into <em>2020</em>, crypto has become an increasingly popular alternative.

Looking back over <em>2021</em>, this gap has widened even further, with <a href=https://ethereum.org/en/>Ethereum</a> starting to make big waves as it outperforms <em>Bitcoin</em> in price appreciation terms this year. Could this be resulting from the process and changes Ethereum is undergoing as it transitions to <em>proof-of-stake</em>?</p>

<h3 id=wall-street-appeal>Wall Street Appeal</h3>
<p>To me, it makes sense that <em>Ethereum&rsquo;s</em> transition to <em>proof-of-stake</em> will garner increased interest from the financial establishment. I only say this because <em>post upgrade</em>, staked <em>Eth</em> will operate more like a <em>digital bond</em>. Instead of being a <em>virtual commodity</em>, it will be closer to a financial asset. Capital gets positioned, and then the yield VS price gets calculated. This makes it simple to regulate and even easier to tax <em>(like a bond yield)</em>.</p>
<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
<p><em>Cryptocurrency</em> is still in its very <em>early</em> stages. Can <em>proof-of-stake</em> have an impact on the heavy energy demands of crypto today? From watching the news or reading any major publications, it would seem that the market is not so much fixated on <em>functionality</em> but on price. With <em>Ethereum</em>, transaction fees increase as the demand for Ethereum rises, which directly impacts the price. To me, this is a direct indication of its utility today, which drives the price higher.</p>
<p>One thing that remains unclear is, what happens to the <em>second-largest</em> coin by market capitalization as it completes this gigantic transition to <em>proof-of-stake</em> and takes on the persona of an <em>interest</em> paying bond or equity? Does this negatively impact the link between <em>Ethereum</em> price and transaction cost, or does increased utility and adoption along with significantly less energy demand drive <em>Ethereum</em> parabolic? The world will soon find out!</p>
