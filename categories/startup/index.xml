This mischaracterization risks confusing the market and overselling capabilities, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t anything new right? Take zero-trust, cloud computing, or even take a look back at the early-2000s with the web revolution. Urs Baumann tossed out a great questions in the Network Automation Forum - Slack recently, and I thought it would make for a good blog (or maybe venting session depending on how you look at it).</description></item><item><title>The Ripple Effect: Could Taxing Unrealized Gains Stifle Innovation?</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2024/taxing-unrealized-gains/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 14:25:07 -0400</pubDate><author><name>William Collins</name></author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2024/taxing-unrealized-gains/</guid><description>In my previous blog on Dilution of Ownership, I explored how startup funding rounds impact equity. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into a hot-button, highly-debated, and dramatically misunderstood matter of policy - taxing unrealized capital gains (or the wealth tax). Could this policy drastically alter the startup landscape? Would there be a tangible impact on founders, investors, and the innovation ecosystem as a whole?
Intro The Allure of Taxing Paper WealthOn the surface, taxing unrealized gains - (the increase in value of an asset that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been sold yet) - might seem like a fair way to ensure the ultra-wealthy pay their &amp;ldquo;fair share.</description></item><item><title>Understanding Dilution of Ownership</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2024/understanding-dilution-of-ownership/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 16:48:03 -0300</pubDate><author><name>William Collins</name></author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2024/understanding-dilution-of-ownership/</guid><description>There is a lot of confusion surrounding the dilution of ownership, especially in the tech startup space. What does this mean in layman&amp;rsquo;s terms? Who does it impact? And most importantly, why you should care if you plan to work for a startup. This is a topic I have discussed with many new (and even some seasoned) engineers over the past few years. I recently had this very discussion with a senior engineer (and close friend) who is leaving big enterprise for startup land.</description></item><item><title>Looking Back At 2022</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2022/looking-back-at-2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 14:25:04 -0500</pubDate><author><name>William Collins</name></author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2022/looking-back-at-2022/</guid><description>At the end of each year, I take some time for self-reflection. Looking back through 2022 gave me a colossal reminder of how vital teams, communities, and leaders are. Take hockey for instance.
