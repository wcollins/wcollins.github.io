Most of the time, it is easy enough to find an answer online or even from ChatGPT. Other times, you may not be so lucky. The other day, I fell victim to a TWE or time wasting event that I thought was worth writing about.</description></item><item><title>Configuring Systems With ChatGPT, Python, and Go</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2023/configuring-systems-with-chatgpt-python-and-go/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2023 12:03:15 -0400</pubDate><author><name>William Collins</name></author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2023/configuring-systems-with-chatgpt-python-and-go/</guid><description>I recently wrote a blog about generating Terraform with ChatGPT. In that experiment, I was using GPT-3.5. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take much to trip up the galactic AI in many of the experiments I did with Terraform and beyond. According to OpenAI GPT-4 soars past its predecessor in its advanced reasoning capabilities. Let&amp;rsquo;s use this model to build code in Python and Go. How will the super titan fair in the Sysadmin arena?</description></item><item><title>Can ChatGPT Terraform Simple Networking In AWS?</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2023/can-chatgpt-terraform-simple-networking-in-aws/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 09:31:12 -0400</pubDate><author><name>William Collins</name></author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2023/can-chatgpt-terraform-simple-networking-in-aws/</guid><description>Usually, when it comes to technology, my grandmother doesn&amp;rsquo;t know much because she doesn&amp;rsquo;t care.

I tend to avoid AI fear-mongering and focus more on, how could a tool like this help enhance my daily grind?</description></item></channel></rss>
