That would be the AWS Summits! This year, I got to experience a double dose of fun by representing Alkira at our booth and presenting at the AWS Community Developer Lounge. I may be biased, but I believe the Alkira team is the best in the world.
It was a blast getting to talk about cloud networking with event attendees while getting a glimpse of how the public sector is adapting to change.</description></item><item><title>AWS re:Invent 2022 - Recap</title><link>http://wcollins.io/posts/2022/aws-reinvent-2022-recap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 08:43:14 -0500</pubDate><author>William Collins</author><guid>http://wcollins.io/posts/2022/aws-reinvent-2022-recap/</guid><description>As far as tech conferences are concerned, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find one as exciting as AWS re:Invent.

I presented on Automating IPAM In Cloud: Ansible + Netbox. You can find the slides along with the demonstration code in this git repo. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to expand a little further on the content I presented.
